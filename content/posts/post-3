Considerign the tidal wave of engagements, bridal showers, save the date's and weddings happening around us - I wouldn't blame if you thought so either.

But that's not this post is about.

I had been toying with an idea of having a site for self for a couple of years now. 
It never really took off though. 

Mostly due to procrastination.

I used Wordpress initially and then later switched to Medium. I never published regularly although I had planned to do once a month in 2020. 

#### That didn't happen either and I blame it on Covid and the lockdown. Ha Ha.

It was during October 2020 that I finally took my debit card and purchased the domain. Basically my intention was to guilt myself to create one due by the Sunk Cost Effect of having made the purchase. 

##  Guilt Driven Development - How about that?

So Yeah, I purchased _**kjfied.com**_ from GoDaddy. 

I think I fiddled around with a couple of static site generators before settling on Hugo. My plan was to use GitHub Pages to host.

I was sure that I wanted something hassle free because I didn't want another reason to put off publishing regularly.

Right when I purchased the domain, I had also made up my mind that I would host and publish the first post before Jan 2021.
**[@ajjuism](https://www.instagram.com/ajjuism/?hl=en)** used to keep reminding on how I never started it now and then adding to the guilt. Ugh!

Days flew by - quite literally till it reached last weekend of Jan 2021. I could not put it off anymore. 

On Saturday (30th Jan), I fired up by laptop by around 11am. I had installed all the prerequisites beforehand.
Without spending a lot of time on choosing the *"perfect"* theme, I chose **[Ezhil](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil)** built by Vivek.

It was important for me to keep in minimal.

I used GitHub Desktop to push to the repo and Netlify to host. I had not used Netlify before but its quite easy breezy to set it up. 

I completed the deployment by 4.47 PM. The issue that took up most of my time was due to the theme not getting rendered while publishing via Netlify because of a single line of hacky code that I copy pasted without properly understanding what it did. Ahem!

###   Now that we have the site up and running - all that is left to do is to regularly, ahem, post, ahem.
