Clubhouse for Android launched on the 21st of March and since I had signed up for the pre-launch, I did receive it on the day itself.

Of course, I was curious about what the hype was surrounding the application which created FOMO for the folks in Twitter to the point of creating invite chains and pay for it.

LOL. 

Over the course of the weekend, I somehow managed to use 4/5 of my invite links to get my friends onboard the platform and spent on an **average of 4-6 hours on it.**

The interface was clean and the quality of both the audio and the conversations in some of the clubs/rooms were top notch.

You could have discussions about various topics, some of them ranging from gender to privacy in tech, ethnic communities, startups and so forth with people from various professional backgrounds, languages and countries. To get their thoughts & perspectives real-time which you would otherwise rarely obtain on another media platform is a huge plus point. 

At least in the rooms that I did manage to spent considerable time in, people were respectful and well behaved although I did hear accounts of raucous behaviour in groups when sensitive topics were mentioned. In fact, moderators were super careful enough to ensure that whenever the conversations started steering to dangerous zones that could potentially sow conflict, it was diffused.

A factor which I liked about the platform is how it has verified accounts and not a thousand faceless bots to spew hateful content or organise targeted slandering of personas. Although I did manage to stumble upon a few groups which did have strongly opinionated questionable conversations which one ought to be wary about and maybe take it with a pinch of salt.

The notifications most certainly did not help - one’s for when each new friend joined or when a new group started.

It turned to a situation where I started opening CH like I used to open Whatsapp unconsciously - FOMO maybe? 

Anyhow, I did turn off the notifications for a week. Hopefully, the buzz would slowly die down sparing the quality.
